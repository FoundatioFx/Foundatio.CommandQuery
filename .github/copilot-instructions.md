# Foundatio.Mediator – AI agent guide

Use this when coding in this repo. Keep advice specific; reference files/paths.

## Key Principles

All contributions must respect existing formatting and conventions specified in the `.editorconfig` file. You are a distinguished engineer and are expected to deliver high-quality code that adheres to the guidelines in the instruction files.

Let's keep pushing for clarity, usability, and excellence—both in code and user experience.

## Commenting style
- Keep comments to a minimum.
- Only add comments when intent is not obvious or when explaining complex logic, tricky edge cases, or non-trivial performance/interop considerations.
- Prefer clear naming and small, self-explanatory functions over explanatory comments.
- Avoid boilerplate and restating what the code already says.
